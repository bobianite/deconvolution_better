The new and improved Richardsonâ€“Lucy deconvolution with OpenCL and FFTW,
now 50 times faster!

- added fft's to do integrals on CPU, and OpenCL to do point-wise arithmetic
on GPU

- proper error handling, if exceptions are encountered, functions will clean
up after themselves, dealloc all buffers, etc etc, which also allows usage in
larger programs without crashing them

- larger programs need only #include "deconvolute.h" and call
deconvolute_image(input, psf, output, number of iterations,
number of threads to use for fftw)

- probably still has many bugs though, but so far runs smoothly

main.c is example usage of deconvolute_image()
